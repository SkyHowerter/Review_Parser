Run the python script and do as instructed.
If you want to use your own golden standard files or test file make sure they are in the working directory.
Gold standard and test files should feature sentences in the following format:

Review-ID This is where your review should go. The review can have many or no complete sentences. At the end of review go to a new line.
Review-ID And start the next review with another ID.

The script will output your answer to terminal, and it will also tell you ID by ID its prediction for each individual review in the "your-test-answer.txt" document.

Thank you!
